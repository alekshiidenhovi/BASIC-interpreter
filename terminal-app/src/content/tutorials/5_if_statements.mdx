<p>IF statements are used to conditionally execute a statement based on whether a condition is true. The syntax for IF statements is the following:</p>

<CodeBlock client:load code="IF <condition> THEN <statement>" />

<p>For instance, the following code will print "ADULT" if the value stored in AGE is greater than or equal to 18:</p>

<CodeBlock client:load code='IF AGE >= 18 THEN PRINT "ADULT"' />

<p>The condition can use any of the following comparison operators: =, !=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, and &gt;=.</p>

<p>The starter code checks whether a student has passed or failed an exam. A score of 50 or above is a pass. Try changing the value of SCORE and observe how the output changes.</p>
