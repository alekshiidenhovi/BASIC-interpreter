<p>If statements are used to execute a block of code if a condition is true. The syntax for IF statements is the following:</p>

<CodeBlock client:load code="IF <condition> THEN <statement>" />

<p>For instance, the following code will print "TRUE" if the number 1 is equal to 1:</p>

<CodeBlock client:load code="IF 1 = 1 THEN PRINT 'TRUE'" />
