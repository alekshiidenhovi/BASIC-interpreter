<p>Typical BASIC is a line-based, interpreted language. Typical BASIC program consists of a series of statements that are executed in order.</p>

<p>On the right side of the screen, there is a simple web-based text-editor that has two lines of code. This is BASIC's version of a simple "Hello world" application.</p>

<p>The first line of code is a PRINT statement. PRINT statements are used to print text to the screen. The syntax for PRINT statements is the following:</p>

<CodeBlock client:load code="PRINT <expression>" />

<p>The second line of code is an END statement. END statements are used to signal the end of a BASIC program. The syntax for END statements is straight-forward, just a plain keyword "END":</p>

<CodeBlock client:load code="END" />

<p>Try running the program on the right side of the screen. You should see text being printed on the bottom part of the editor.</p>
