<p>This interpreter supports a limited set of expressions, from basic arithmetic operations to logical comparison expressions. Expressions have the following general skeleton:</p>

<CodeBlock client:load code="<lhs> <operator> <rhs>" />

<p>Available arithmetic operators include /, *, +, -, and ^ operators, while comparison operations can be performed with the help of =, !=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, and &gt;= operators. You can combine multiple operators to construct more complex expressions. All of the following are valid expressions in Typical BASIC:</p>

<CodeBlock client:load code="-3 / 4" />
<CodeBlock client:load code="10 + 3 * 2 / 4" />
<CodeBlock client:load code="(10 - 3) < (2.4 + 2.2 * 3)" />

<p>Try printing these expressions on the right side of the screen, and see what they evaluate to.</p>
