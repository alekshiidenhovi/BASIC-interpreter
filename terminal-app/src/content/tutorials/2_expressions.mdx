<p>This interpreter supports a limited set of expressions, including basic arithmetic operations and comparison expressions. Expressions have the following general skeleton:</p>

<CodeBlock client:load code="<lhs> <operator> <rhs>" />

<p>You can use a combination of a LET statements and an arithmatic expressions to store a value in a variable. For instance, the following will store the value 7 to variable "NUM":</p>

<CodeBlock client:load code="LET NUM = 10 - 3" />

<p>Comparison expressions evaluate to either TRUE or FALSE. For instance, the following will store TRUE to variable "IS_GREATER":</p>

<CodeBlock client:load code="LET IS_GREATER = 10 > 5" />
