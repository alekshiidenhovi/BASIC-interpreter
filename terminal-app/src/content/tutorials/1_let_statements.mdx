Storing variables is done with LET statements. The syntax for LET statements is the following:

<CodeBlock client:load code="LET <variable-name> = <numeric-value>" />

<p>More concretely, a simple LET statement could look like the following:</p>

<CodeBlock client:load code="LET HELLO_VARIABLE = 10" />
