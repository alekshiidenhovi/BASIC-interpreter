<p>You can add comments to your code by using a REM(ark) statement. When the interpreter encounters a REM keyword at the start of a statement, it ignores the rest of the line and continues to the next line.</p> 

An example of a comment is the following:

<CodeBlock client:load code="REM This is a comment" />

<p>You can use comments to explain your code, or to temporarily disable a line of code.</p>

<p>The code in the editor includes a statement that does not belong there that crashes the program. Try fixing it by turning the line into a comment by using the REM keyword. The correct results should be between 1600 and 1700.</p>
